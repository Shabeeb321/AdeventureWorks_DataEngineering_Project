# End-to-End Data Engineering Project: Azure Data Pipeline with ADF, Databricks & Synapse Analytics

This project demonstrates the development of a comprehensive dynamic data pipeline built using Microsoft Azure services. It covers the entire ETL process, from data ingestion and transformation to analytics and visualization. The pipeline leverages Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark to process and analyze large datasets efficiently.

# Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a scalable and dynamic data pipeline that can handle big data and perform real-time processing. The architecture includes the following key Azure components:

a) Azure Data Factory (ADF): Orchestrates and automates data movement and transformation.  
  
b) Azure Data Lake: Provides a secure and scalable data storage layer for raw data.
  
c) Databricks & Apache Spark: Handles data transformation and real-time processing.  
  
d) Azure Synapse Analytics: Serves as the analytics platform for data warehousing and querying.

# Architecture

The pipeline follows a modular approach and consists of the following stages:

1. Data Ingestion: Data is ingested from various sources and stored in Azure Data Lake.
2. Data Transformation: Databricks & Apache Spark are used to perform data cleaning, transformation, and real-time processing.
3. Data Warehousing: Transformed data is stored in Azure Synapse Analytics for optimized querying and analytics.
4. Analytics & Reporting: Synapse Analytics is used to run analytical queries and generate insights from the processed data.
